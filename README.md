# 0chat

Demonstration for simplified legacy HTML chat CGI like "Yui Chat".

## Description

"Yui Chat" is very popular chat software in Japan around 2000.

Its essentials are "HTML frame", "HTML meta reload", "Form frame and log frame".
I made them with minimized way.

## Usage

Put all files on your CGI executable path and make `archives` directory.

## WARNING

Its goal is *ONLY FOR* showing that the way is working.
